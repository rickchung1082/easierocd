Tiva C Series TM4C123GH6PM Data Sheet
Section 5.2.1 Device Identification

DID0, DID1 registers: device version, package, temperature range
PPWD etc: (System Control 0x300) how many of each kind of peripheral (e.g. watch dog) are present

"information about the capabilities of the on-chip peripherals are provided at offset 0xFC0 in each peripheral's register space in the Peripheral Properties registers, such as the GPTM Peripheral
Properties (GPTMPP) register. Previous devices used the Device Capabilities (DC0-DC9) registers for information about the peripherals and their capabilities. These registers are present on this device for backward software capability, but provide no information about peripherals that were not available
on older devices"
	
The DID0 register identifies the version of the microcontroller

Register 2: Device Identification 1 (DID1), offset 0x004
This register identifies the device family, part number, temperature range, pin count, and package
type. Each microcontroller is uniquely identified by the combined values of the CLASS field in the
DID0 register and the PARTNO field in the DID1 register.
