"25. Chip Identifier (CHIPID)
25.1 Description
Chip Identifier (CHIPID) registers permit recognition of the device and its revision. These registers provide the
sizes and types of the on-chip memories, as well as the set of embedded peripherals.
Two chip identifier registers are embedded: CHIPID_CIDR (Chip ID Register) and CHIPID_EXID (Extension ID).
Both registers contain a hard-wired value that is read-only. The first register contains the following fields:
 EXT: Shows the use of the extension identifier register
 NVPTYP and NVPSIZ: Identify the type of embedded non-volatile memory and the size
 ARCH: Identifies the set of embedded peripherals
 SRAMSIZ: Indicates the size of the embedded SRAM
 EPROC: Indicates the embedded ARM processor
 VERSION: Identifies the revision of the silicon
The second register is device-dependent and reads 0 if the bit EXT is 0"
