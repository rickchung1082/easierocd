* ST-Link/V2: detect stlink firmware version to warn about serial number change bug and ask user to update the firmware
* ST-Link/V2: detect target voltage, 

* OpenOCD: 2nd tcl port connect
* OpenOCD: reset-init clock setup, squire this with CMSIS SystemClock somehow

DONE:
* st-link/v2 serial keeps changing
	* Happens to both standalone dongles and discovery boards
	* SOLUTION: firmware update: http://wunderkis.de/stlink-serialno/index.html 
* easierocd/arm: map 'partno' to Cortex-M product names 'cortex_m0_r0p0'
* tmux: session cleanup
	Linux USB (bus, addr), the 'addr' part keeps incraesing
	(NOT DONE): Have libexec/pause exit on openocd daemon exit
