* TCL RPC doesn't allow a second client to connect
	Need at least a "connection in use" response

* openocd -c noinit
	> exit
	The 'exit' command must be used after 'init'.
	in procedure 'exit'

* gdb and OpenOCD disagree on whether the target is halted without "openocd -c halt"
	http://sourceforge.net/p/openocd/mailman/message/28439071/

	Solution: let GDB know that the target isn't halted.  gdb has non-stop mode now.
	Implement it in OpenOCD and advertise support through the gdbserver remote protocol.

** gdb> interrupt doesn't work
	(OpenOCD non-RTOS aware mode) halt processor
	(OpenOCD RTOS aware mode) Stop current thread. "interrupt -a" stops all threads

** gdb> attach 0 doesnt work

* Disconnect USB debug adapter using SWD transport after succesful init
	TCL RPC responds with '' to many commands
	Wish list: command to query adapter connection
	Event hook for polling failure: this could need a different stream-socket like connection from TCL RPC

* ARM Semihosting messages are too slow
	Much slower than texan/stlink
	Similar request from OpenOCD user: Slow DCC message: How to increase polling frequency? (https://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg13746.html)

= GDB Issues
* (Likely gdb issue)
	GDB stepi (single instruction step) can't step over "bkpt 0xAB" instruction used to issue ARM semihosting syscall
