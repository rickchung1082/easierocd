* openocd -c noinit
	> exit
	The 'exit' command must be used after 'init'.

* Disconnect USB debug adapter using SWD transport after succesful init
	TCL RPC responds with '' to many commands
	Wish list: command to query adapter connection
	Event hook for polling failure

* ARM Semihosting messages are too slow
	Obviously slower than stlink
	Similar request from OpenOCD user: Slow DCC message: How to increase polling frequency? (https://www.mail-archive.com/openocd-development@lists.berlios.de/msg13746.html)

* (Likely gdb issue)
	GDB stepi (single instruction step) can't step over "bkpt 0xAB" instruction used to issue ARM semihosting syscall
